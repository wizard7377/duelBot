## Drawing Coordinates
Coordinates, as it pertains to drawing, are done in the traditional ***OpenCV*** style for all boards, that is to say, all coordinates are in the form (y,x), where (0,0) is at the top left.


| Example | Coordinates |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| (0,0) | (0,1) |
| (1,0) | (1,1) |
